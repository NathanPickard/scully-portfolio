Coding and building software really is an art form.  In many ways, the best path to becoming a better builder of software is to get your hands dirty and simply code. But sometimes the best method to become a better programmer is to take a step back, shift gears, and look past the act of coding itself.  In this blog post I'll discuss some resources and ways to become a better web developer when you're not in front of the keyboard, building out your next app component, or hammering away at your next http request.

### Podcasts:

Listening to podcasts is an excellent way to increase your coding knowledge no matter where you are.  While getting some daily exercise, tackling the everyday chores, or making the commute to and from work, a great podcast can allow you to expand your coding horizons, keep up-to-date with current industry trends, and gain extremely insightful information from the biggest names in tech.  I've listed the following podcasts below that I've found to be engaging, informative, and well worth the time.

- [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/):

'A Tasty Treats Podcast for Web Developers'

Hosted by the ever popular [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) and co-host [Scott Tolinski](http://scotttolinski.com/), in this podcast show they chat weekly about all things web development, such as [various development techniques](https://syntax.fm/show/026/all-about-redux-and-and-cookies-vs-jwt), [how to keep up in the fast paced world of tech](https://syntax.fm/show/035/keeping-up-with-the-codeashians-dealing-with-our-fast-paced-industry), as well as [sharing a peek](https://syntax.fm/show/031/wes-and-scott-s-lives-breakdancing-bbq-wives-work-life-balance-problem-solving-youtube-subscriptions) into their personal lives as busy developers.  Towards the end of each podcast, Scott and Wes do "Sick Picks" or shout-outs about anything they're currently excited about, whether be it a product, service, current event, etc.  This is a great all-around web development podcast that is approachable to beginners while still having in-depth discussions about many technical topics.  Sick!

- [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber):

This weekly podcast covers all things javascript related and the communities involved.  Hosted by [Charles Max Wood](https://twitter.com/cmaxw), each episode provides deep discussions on many javascript/web development-based technologies with some of the top experts in the industry.  From [evaluating web frameworks](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-302-evaluating-web-frameworks-kitson-kelly) to discussions on [developers as entrepreneurs](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-295-developers-entrepreneurs-ryan-glover), each week provides essential updates on current happenings within the industry.

Every other week Charles chats with top developers and industry leaders in episodes called 'My JavaScript Story'.  During each show the guest discusses their journey into programming and how they got started in the tech world.  They also go in depth about what they are currently working on and excited about.   The chat with [Austin McDaniel](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/mjs-041-austin-mcdaniel) is definitely worth a listen as he's currently contributing to Angular while also working on [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

Those that are involved in the tech space, but may not do any direct development themselves, can still listen to JavaScript Jabber and see where the ever-evolving web development space is heading.

- [Learn To Code With Me](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/) and [Code Newbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast):

The Learn To Code With Me and Code Newbie podcasts are similar in that they are excellent resources for aspiring web developers and those perhaps looking for a change in career.  While these two podcasts are generally geared for aspiring techies and self-taught coders, those that have a good deal of coding experience can still get a ton out of these shows.

[Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek) of Code Newbie and [Laurence Bradford](https://twitter.com/learncodewithme) of LTCWM each interview experts from many different sectors of the tech world.  Each episode is easy for a beginner to digest, while still providing tons of insight and current information from people that are the movers and shakers of the industry.  One of my favorite episodes from Code Newbie discusses the [value of a Computer Science degree](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/should-you-get-a-computer-science-degree), while LTCWM's discussion with [@Bill Sourour](https://twitter.com/billsourour) on his [programming career](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/from-theatre-to-programming-with-dev-mastery-founder-bill-sourour/) is quite inspiring and worth a listen.

### Health and Exercise:

Mind and body are most certainly connected to each other, so taking care of your health and fitness needs are important when sharpening your skills on your various coding ventures.  So, to code at your very best, it's imperative that you form health-conscience habits that your body naturally craves and will thank you for.

![animal-koala-nature.jpg](images/animal-koala-nature.jpg)You always hear about the stereotypical late-night programmer, hammering away on the keyboard late into the night.  While this may work OK for some coders, I've made it a point to close up shop no less than an hour and a half before I hit the sack.  I've personally found that I'm more productive during daytime hours, rather than coding late into the night.  After the laptop lid is closed, I check my agenda and make sure I'm set for the following day and on track for my weekly goals.  A [good night's sleep](http://programmergoals.com/sleep-more-code-more/) is vital and you owe it to yourself to get quality shut eye.

### ![pexels-photo-209482.jpeg](images/pexels-photo-209482.jpeg)

Eating right and making sure you're properly nurturing your body with the nutrients it craves is equally important.  While it's common knowledge about what a balanced diet for most people would consists of, drinking plenty of water throughout the day and [consuming foods](https://codecrave.io/food-for-programmers/) that can promote brain function is a no brainer!

Exercise and maintaining great personal health go hand in hand.  For many people, it's one of those things that you mean to get around to and know you should do, but don't quite go through with it.  As coders, we spend a good amount of time sitting, so moving around and getting the blood flowing should definitely be a priority.  It's much easier to get your needed exercise when you have a designated time of day set aside just for this.  Once it becomes habitual, you automatically get into the routine and you don't have to think twice about making sure you get your daily exercise.

One resource I recommend for getting your fitness needs fulfilled is the [HASfit Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/KozakSportsPerform) channel.  All of the workouts and routines can easily be done from the comfort of your own home without having to make a trip to the gym.  Coach Kozak and his partner Claudia guide you through each workout, from easy-going [beginner](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRCgg2aTq5NWDgXKX0D-7HlVtCuNjesC4) routines to [strength training](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEDBB97DCA7B48E58).  They have tons of free workouts ranging anywhere from five minutes to an hour in length, so choosing an exercise that can fit in your schedule on any given day is definitely a huge plus.  Apart from other free content out there, they have a wide range of workouts and they don't try to sell you anything before the routine starts.  Also, the videos are straight forward and easy to just jump right in, so before breaking a sweat, give 'em a try!

Your overall well-being is extremely important and directly effects the quality of the code you write.  The most important aspect to keeping your overall health maintained while being an active developer is to make sure your [habits and routines](https://www.wanderlustworker.com/the-8-best-programming-habits-all-coders-should-have/) are set in place.  Becoming a better software developer obviously doesn't happen overnight, so it's the small habits that compound into great achievements and worthwhile learning experiences.  In my next blog post, I'll share and discuss some other resources that have really aided me on my ongoing coding journey and I hope they'll benefit your own.  Join me!
