Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post and I'm excited to share all the work I've done, projects I'm currently building, and all the subjects I plan on sinking my teeth into. Web technologies and all of it's innovations and challenges it presents is what gets me excited about my own app development and learning.

I am currently making the transition from [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) to the [ever-evolving](https://dzone.com/articles/angular-who) [Angular](https://angular.io) framework. With the younger Angular becoming more prevalent than its older brother in the web development space, there's no better time than now to start studying up on it, building new experiences, and smartly restructuring older AngularJS apps. I gotta say, I'm really diggin' the modularity of Angular's component architecture!

There is a wealth of many great [resources](https://scotch.io/guides/angular) and blogs to follow that I've come across while researching courses, how to be a better developer, and best practices. One course that I'm currently working through is ['Angular: Getting Started'](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-2-getting-started-update) by Deborah Kurata from pluralsight. She's a member of the official [Angular docs](https://angular.io/docs) team, so you know it's good stuff. The tutorial offers an excellent overview of Angular itself, serves as a great foundation to further expand upon, and I highly recommend it. Thanks [@DeborahKurata](https://twitter.com/DeborahKurata)!

Taking one, dare I say, "byte" at a time to break down, expand my knowledge, and give back to the community in my own way is what this blog is all about. Thank you for reading, stay tuned, and happy coding!
